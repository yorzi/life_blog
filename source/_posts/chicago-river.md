# Chicago River

I've never been in Chicago,

but, I know, there is a river, across the city.

Bright light nearby at night, like a dream.

Hope ended when gazing at the brilliant view, 

and love changed when being under the sky.

Night always is unbelievable,

specially, that filled of illusion,color and light.  
So, I build the dream, and  
the dream build me.
