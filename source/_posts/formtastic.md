# Again about Formtastic

Actually, I don't know how fantastic Formtastic is before this afternoon, I used it to refactor my form and it's pretty cool for me to wrap up all the massive code which I hate as always. Now every form is becoming nice. Some relevant and useful additions about Formtastic: 

**SASS-stylesheets** – for even more pretty styled forms in all browsers (mixins for different form layouts, etc.)
