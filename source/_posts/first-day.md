# First Day

"It's frustrating when your long-term goals seem so far off that you believe you won't reach them. Don't throw in the towel just yet, for your perspective is a bit warped by Saturn the Tester who might be making things look less than optimum. Instead of giving up, recommit to what's most important. Then after a few days of hard work, reassess your situation before making a final decision."  
  
Definitely, I know my situation.
