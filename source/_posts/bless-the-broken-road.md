# Bless The Broken Road

Rascal Flatts  
  
I set out on a narrow way many years ago   
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road   
But I got lost a time or two   
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through   
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you   
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are   
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars   
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms   
This much I know is true   
That God blessed the broken road   
That led me straight to you   
  
I think about the years I spent just passing through   
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you   
But you just smile and take my hand   
You've been there you understand   
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true   
  
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are   
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars   
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms   
This much I know is true   
That God blessed the broken road   
That led me straight to you
