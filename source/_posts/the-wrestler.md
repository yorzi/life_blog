# The.Wrestler

[THE WRESTLERÂ©](http://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics/t/thewrestler.php) [Listen online!](/wp-content/uploads/music/the.wrestler.mp3) Have you ever seen a one trick pony in the field so happy and free If you've ever seen a one trick pony then you've seen me Have you ever seen a one legged dog makin' his way down the street If you've ever seen a one legged dog then you've seen me (Then you've seen me) I come and stand at every door (Then you've seen me) I always leave with less than I had before (Then you've seen me) bet I can make you smile when the blood it hits the floor Tell me friend can you ask for anything more Tell me can you ask for anything more Have you ever seen a scarecrow filled with nothing but dust and weeds If you've ever seen that scarecrow then you've seen me Have you ever seen a one armed man punchin' at nothing but the breeze If you've ever seen a one armed man then you've seen me (Then you've seen me) I come and stand at every door (Then you've seen me) I always leave with less than I had before (Then you've seen me) bet I can make you smile when the blood it hits the floor Tell me friend can you ask for anything more Tell me can you ask for anything more These things that have comforted me I drive away (anything more) This place that is my home I cannot stay (anything more) My only faith is in the broken bones and bruises I display Have you ever seen a one legged man tryin' to dance his way free If you've ever seen a one legged man then you've seen me [_PS, Thanks to the provider, LOVE this song very much_]
