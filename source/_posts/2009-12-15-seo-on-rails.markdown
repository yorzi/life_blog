<p><div>This post is a copy of my work stuff, but I want to archive all the links below, they are all about SEO on Rails application, as well as a useful post about jQuery on Rails.

<p>Finally, we decided to create a Rails App for the EQV2 New Website, so I did several homework for this mission. They are:</p>

<p>1. SEO on Rails.<br />
Several rules/good points for seo according to the following websites:<br />

<p>2. Maybe use JQuery more in EQV2.<br />

<p>3. Cache Views.</p>

<p>MORE IDEAS?</p>

<p>But, first version should be structured well and make sure it's been done before the "deadline", so this app will be according to the recommendation but not totally implemented in the best way, in all, it still needs your suggestion.
