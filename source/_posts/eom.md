# EOM

Eyes On Me  
Faye Wong  
  
Whenever sang my songs  
On the stage, on my own  
Whenever said my words  
Wishing they would be heard  
I saw you smiling at me  
Was it real or just my fantasy  
You'd always be there in the corner  
Of this tiny little bar  
  
My last night here for you  
Same old songs, just once more  
My last night here with you?  
Maybe yes, maybe no  
I kind of liked it your way  
How you shyly placed your eyes on me  
Oh, did you ever know?  
That I had mine on you  
  
Darling, so there you are  
With that look on your face  
As if you're never hurt  
As if you're never down  
Shall I be the one for you  
Who pinches you softly but sure  
If frown is shown then  
I will know that you are no dreamer  
  
So let me come to you  
Close as I wanted to be  
Close enough for me  
To feel your heart beating fast  
And stay there as I whisper  
How I loved your peaceful eyes on me  
Did you ever know  
That I had mine on you  
  
Darling, so share with me  
Your love if you have enough  
Your tears if you're holding back  
Or pain if that's what it is  
How can I let you know  
I'm more than the dress and the voice  
Just reach me out then  
You will know that you're not dreaming

The Beach Boys - God Only Knows  
  
I may not always love you  
But long as there are stars above you  
You never need to doubt it  
I'll make you so sure about it  
  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
  
If you should ever leave me  
Though life would still go on believe me  
The world could show nothing to me  
So what good would living do me  
  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
  
If you should ever leave me  
Well, life would still go on believe me  
The world could show nothing to me  
So what good would living do me  
  
God only knows what I'd be without you
