# was young

很简单

就在我们状态不好的时候

许多事情

做错了

 ======================================================================

第六句  
就算是believe  中间也藏了一个lie

Take a look at us  
Hate where there was lust  
The trip like honey

 

But lust don’t mean a thing  
When all we do is shout and scream  
It’s almost funny

 

We’re like clowns  
Tumbled into town now  
Love is on its way down now  
It’s such a lonely sound

 

Mouths that once exchanged  
Kisses in the rain  
Are full of pain now

 

It all seems so absurd  
When every sentence and every word  
Is so painful

 

Clowns  
Tumbled into town now  
Love is on its way down now  
Such a lonely sound

 

Clowns  
Faces with painted frowns now  
Sat on a merry-go-round now  
Such a lonely sound
