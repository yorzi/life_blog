# Don't write me off

=================================================  
**It's never been easy for me**  
** To find words to go along, with a melody**  
** But this time there's actually something, on my mind**  
** So please forgive these few brief awkward lines**  
  
** Since I've met you, my whole life has changed**  
** It's not just my furniture, you've rearranged**  
** I was living in the past, but somehow you've brought me back**  
** And I haven't felt like this since before Frankie said relax**  
  
** And while I know, based on my track record**  
** I might not seem like the safest bet**  
** All I'm asking you, is don't write me off, just yet**  
  
** For years I've been telling myself, the same old story**  
** That I'm happy to live off my so called, former glories**  
** But you've given me a reason, to take another chance**  
** Now I need you, despite the fact, that you've killed all my plants**  
  
** And though I know, I've already blown more chances**  
** Than anyone should ever get**  
** All I'm asking you, is don't write me off, just yet**  
** Don't write me off just yet**
