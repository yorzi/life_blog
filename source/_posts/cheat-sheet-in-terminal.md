# Cheat sheet in terminal

I found a cool gem called "cheat", it's pretty handy and convenient when you wanna see a brief help/introduction of some "stuff" in command line, cheat out the website for more [wiki-versioned cheat sheet](http://cheat.errtheblog.com/b). 

> Get started: _$ sudo gem install cheat $ cheat strftime_ A magnificent cheat sheet for Ruby's strftime method will be printed to your terminal. To get some help on cheat itself: _$ cheat cheat_ How meta. Cheat sheets are basically wiki pages accessible from the command line. You can browse, add, or edit cheat sheets. Try to keep them concise. For a style guide, check out the cheat cheat sheet. To access a cheat sheet, simply pass the program the desired sheet's name: _$ cheat _
